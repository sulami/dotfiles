* Dotfiles
Home sweet home.

If you are looking for my Emacs config, [[file:emacs/.emacs.d][look no further]].

** Installation
Clone this repository to ~$HOME/dotfiles~ with ~git clone --recurse-submodules
https://github.com/sulami/dotfiles~. Then run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
stow -v emacs
stow -v git
stow -v leiningen
stow -v tmux
stow -v vim
stow -v zsh
#+END_SRC

** Notes
The ~install.sh~ script and the ~configs~ directory aren't ~stow~-able. ~install.sh~ is
a whole system-setup for macOS (and includes cloning this repo), and ~configs~ is
just a mixed bag of, well, configs.
